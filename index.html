        <h2>Yadid's History</h2>
        <p>When I was younger, I used to wake up to the crows of roosters, to the songs of the chirping swallows, to the mooing of cows asking to be fed. for eight years of my life, I lived in the coolest farm ever in a house made completely of cement. It was the only life I knew until I moved to the city. Adjusting to living in Chicago was an exciting yet challenging process. The busy city was a complete 180 difference from my life in Mexico. Learning the language and culture took time, but I appreciate where I am. If someone were to go back in time and tell a seven year old me that I would be in college in the United States, the little me would be in disbelief. I am proud of my accomplishments and how far I have come, however, and I am excited to use my privilege of being here to continue growing.</p>
        <h2>Yadid's Education</h2>
        <p>I completed all my higher education in Chicago, IL. I attended Marie Sklodowska Curie Metropolitan High School in Brighton Park. I was part of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, which allowed me to graduate with a weighed GPA of 5.22. One of my greatest accomplishments was graduating as Valedictorian of my high school class. Considering that I came from foreign background, I challenged myself and overachieved. Another great accomplishment from high school was becoming the Team Captain of the school's Academic Decathlon Team. As part of the competition, I always finished with the awards for Highest Team and Division Scorer at City Championship and Regional competitions. I also participated in the city's Science Fair. For my participation and research, I was awarded Gold recognition for the Science Fair Symposium portion at the State Science Fair (IJAS) and city competition.</p>
        <p>I decided to attend Illinois Institute of Technology in the Bronzeville neighborhood. I wanted to major in a STEM related field, and Illinois Tech has a great reputation in STEM majors. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science Degree in Applied Analytics with a specialization in Social Sciences. Through my studies at Illinois Tech, I have learned how to analyze and effectively communicate data sets. I have gained experience extracting data sets with R in RStudio, creating and filling databases with SQL in SQL Developer, and analyzing and visualizing data with IBM SPSS. I also have extensive experience using Microsoft Access, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint, as well as the editor Atom, and using GIT for web development.</p>
        <h2>Yadid's Work Experiences</h2>
        <p>My first official job was as a Phonathon Caller at the Illinois Institute of Technology Office of Institutional Advancement. For three semester, I learned how to proactively engage a diverse group of alumni and convince them to support the university's fundraising goals. I then worked in customer service at the Nike Store in Chicago’s Magnificent Mile as an Under Athlete. Through my 18 months there, I gained more experience on how to effectively communicate with diverse groups of people.</p>
        <p>My first internship was in the summer of 2016 as a Data Collector intern working at Midway Airport in partnership with Rico Enterprises and Boingo. As a Data Collector intern I learned to effectively gather data from diverse group of busy people while working with a partner. For the following two summers I have been interning at the Museum of Science and Industry as a Guest Experiences intern. Through my work at this world class museum with an annual attendance of over 1.5 million guests, I have improved my skills in communicating effectively and proactively.</p>
        <h2>Yadid's Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Outside of work and school, I enjoy playing adventure games on the PS4 and watching Game of Thrones. I have two wonderful dogs that I take care of, Bonbon and Oliver, both Australian Cattle Dogs.</p>
