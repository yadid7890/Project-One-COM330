      <h2>Yadid's History</h2>
      <p>
        When I was younger, I used to wake up to the crows of roosters, to the songs of the
        chirping swallows, to the mooing of cows asking to be fed. For eight years of my life, I
        lived in the coolest farm ever in a house made completely of cement. It was the only life
        I knew until I moved to the city. Adjusting to living in Chicago was an exciting yet
        challenging process. The busy city was a complete 180 difference from my life in Mexico.
        Learning the language and culture took time, but I appreciate where I am. If someone were
        to go back in time and tell a seven year old me that I would be in college in the United
        States, the little me would be in disbelief. I am proud of my accomplishments and how far
        I have come, however, and I am excited to use my privilege of being here to continue
        growing.

      <h2>Yadid's Education</h2>
      <p>
        I completed all my higher education in Chicago, IL. I attended Marie Sklodowska Curie
        Metropolitan High School in Brighton Park. I was part of the International Baccalaureate
        Diploma Programme, which allowed me to graduate with a weighed GPA of 5.22. One of my
        greatest accomplishments was graduating as Valedictorian of my high school class.
        Considering that I came from foreign background, I challenged myself and overachieved.
        Another great accomplishment from high school was being anonymously elected the Team
        Captain of the school's Academic Decathlon Team. As part of the competition, I always
        finished with the awards for Highest Team and Division Scorer at City Championship and
        Regional competitions. I also participated in the city's Science Fair. For my
        participation and research, I was awarded Gold recognition for the Science Fair Symposium
        portion at the State Science Fair (IJAS) and city competition.

      <p>
        I decided to attend Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. I wanted to major in a
        STEM related field, and Illinois Tech has a great reputation in STEM majors. I am pursuing
        a Bachelor of Science Degree in Applied Analytics with a specialization in Social
        Sciences. Through my studies at Illinois Tech, I have learned how to analyze and
        effectively communicate data sets in meaninful ways. I have gained experience extracting
        data sets with R in RStudio, creating and filling databases with SQL in SQL Developer, and
        analyzing and visualizing data with IBM SPSS. I also have extensive experience using
        Microsoft Access, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint, as well as the editor Atom, and using GIT
        for web development.

      <h2>Yadid's Work Experiences</h2>
      <p>
        My first official job was as a Phonathon Caller at the Illinois Institute of Technology
        Office of Institutional Advancement. For three semesters, I learned how to proactively
        engage a diverse group of alumni and convince them to support the university's fundraising
        goals. I then worked in customer service at the Nike Store in Chicago’s Magnificent Mile
        as an Under Athlete. Through my 18 months there, I gained more experience on how to
        effectively communicate with diverse groups of people.

        My first internship was in the summer of 2016 as a Data Collector intern working at Midway
        Airport in partnership with Rico Enterprises and Boingo. As a Data Collector intern I
        learned to effectively gather data from diverse group of busy people while working with a
        partner. For the past two summers I have been interning at the Museum of Science and
        Industry as a Guest Experiences Intern. Through my work at this world class museum with an
        annual attendance of over 1.5 million guests, I have improved my skills in communicating
        effectively and proactively to large and diverse groups of individuals.

      <h2>Yadid's Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of work and school, I enjoy playing adventure games on the PS4 such as Horizon
        Zero Dawn, Detroit Become Human, and the Final Fantasy Series. E3 in 2018 released a lot
        of great trailers for new games, and I cannot wait to get my hands on them. I also enjoy
        watching a variety of TV shows, my favorites include Game of Thrones, Bob's Burgers, and
        The Man in the High Castle. I have two wonderful dogs that I adore and spoil, Bonbon and
        Oliver, both Australian Cattle Dogs.
